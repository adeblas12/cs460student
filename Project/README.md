# Albert's Algorithm Visualizer

## Description
Albert's Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based tool designed to help students, specifically in algorithm courses, understand the process of how algorithms go through in order to sort wide sets of data.

## Features
- Visualizes sorting algorithms step-by-step. Color coded bars, that are portional to each other that swap as the different algorthims move the values in between steps.
- Interactive controls to pause, resume, and adjust the speed of the animation.(WIP)
- Supports multiple algorithms: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort.

## In progress Features
- Adding Scheduling Algorthims from Operating Systems
- Adding Algorithm Descriptions and Complexity Analysis
- The ability to have a Comparative Mode, users can compare different algorthims to each other
- Interactive Quiz or Challenges: where users can try to guess the next step in the algorithm.
## Installation and Setup
Simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in a modern web browser to use the visualizer.

## How to Use
1. Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2. Enter a comma-separated list of numbers in the input field.
3. Click 'Enter' to visualize the sorting algorithm.
4. Use the control panel to pause/resume the animation, change its speed, or step through the process(WIP:Broken)
